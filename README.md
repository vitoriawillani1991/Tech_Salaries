# Technology Professionals' Salary Analysis

This project aims to provide insights into the salaries of technology professionals by conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and implementing machine learning models to predict salaries. The dataset used in this analysis contains information on gender, education level, years of experience, job titles, and corresponding salaries.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this section, we explore the dataset to answer the following questions:

<a name="gender-salary-difference"></a>
### Is there a high difference in salary between genders?
We analyze the gender pay gap within the technology industry to identify any significant disparities.

<a name="education-salary"></a>
### What is the average salary for a given education level?
We investigate how education levels impact salary and calculate average salaries for various education levels.

<a name="experience-salary"></a>
### What is the average salary for a given year of experience?
We examine the relationship between years of experience and salary, providing insights into how experience influences earnings.

<a name="job-title-salary"></a>
### What is the average salary for every job title?
We analyze salary distributions across different job titles within the technology sector.

<a name="machine-learning"></a>
## Machine Learning
In this section, we build machine learning models to predict technology professionals' salaries based on the provided features.

<a name="model-selection"></a>
### Model Selection
We evaluate five different machine learning models to predict salaries and compare their performance. The models include neural networks, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

<a name="best-model-knn"></a>
### Best Performing Model: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
After rigorous evaluation, we determine that the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model outperforms the others in terms of predictive accuracy for salary estimation. We provide details on the model's implementation, hyperparameter tuning, and performance metrics.
